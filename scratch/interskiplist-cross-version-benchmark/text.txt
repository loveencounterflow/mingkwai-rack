{{See also|Names of Beijing}}
Over the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had [[names of Beijing|numerous other names]]. The name '''Beijing''', which means "Northern Capital" (from the [[Chinese characters]] {{lang|zh|北}} for ''north'' and {{lang|zh|京}} for ''capital''), was applied to the city in 1403 during the [[Ming Dynasty]] to distinguish the city from [[Nanjing]] (the "Southern Capital").<ref name="minggov">Hucker, Charles O.

==History==
{{Main article|History of Beijing}}

===Early history===
The earliest traces of human habitation in the Beijing municipality were found in the caves of [[Dragon Bone Hill]] near the village of [[Zhoukoudian]] in [[Fangshan District]], where [[Peking Man]] lived. ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. [[Paleolithic]] ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/ext/field/beijing/whc/pkm-site.htm|title=The Peking Man World Heritage Site at Zhoukoudian}}</ref> Archaeologists have found [[neolithic]] settlements throughout the municipality, including in [[Wangfujing]], located in downtown Beijing.

The first [[ancient Chinese urban planning|walled city]] in Beijing was '''[[state of Ji|Ji]]''', a city-state from the 11th to 7th century BC.<!--not BCE; see talk--> Within modern Beijing, Ji was located south of the present [[Beijing West Railway Station]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title=Beijing's History |url=http://china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30785.htm |publisher=China Internet Information Center|accessdate=1 May 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080501152800/http://www1.china.org.cn/english/features/beijing/30785.htm| archivedate= 1 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This settlement was later conquered by the [[state of Yan]] and made its capital under the name '''[[Yanjing]]'''.<ref>Haw, Stephen. ''Beijing: A Concise History''. Routledge, 2007. p. 136.</ref>

===Early Imperial China===
[[File:Tianning Temple Pagoda.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pagoda of Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianning Pagoda]], built around 1120.]]
After the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] [[Qin's wars of unification|unified China]], Beijing became a [[zhou (region)|prefectural capital]] for the region.<ref name="hist" /> During the [[Three Kingdoms period]], it was held by [[Gongsun Zan]] and [[Yuan Shao]] before falling to [[Cao Cao]]'s [[Cao Wei|Wei Kingdom]]. The AD 3rd-century [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Western Jin]] demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou.

During the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] period when northern China was conquered and divided by the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]], Beijing, as '''[[Jicheng (Beijing)|Jicheng]]''', was briefly the capital of the [[Xianbei]] [[Former Yan]] Kingdom.<ref name=Rene>{{cite book |last=Grousset |first=Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1970 |isbn=0-8135-1304-9 |page=58}}</ref>

After China was reunified during the [[Sui Dynasty]], Beijing, known as '''Zhuojun''', became the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]].  Under the [[Tang Dynasty]], Beijing as '''[[Fanyang]]''', served as a military frontier command center. During the [[An-Shi Rebellion]] and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan Dynasties and called the city '''[[Yanjing]]''', or the "Yan Capital."  In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]] ceded [[sixteen Prefectures|the entire northern frontier]] to the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao Dynasty]], which renamed the city [[Liao Nanjing|Nanjing]], or the "Southern Capital", one of four secondary capitals to complement its "Supreme Capital", Shangjing (modern [[Baarin Left Banner]] in [[Inner Mongolia]]).  Some of the oldest surviving structures in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the [[Pagoda of Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianning Pagoda]].

The Liao fell to the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchen Jin dynasty]] in 1122, which gave the city to the [[Song Dynasty]] and then retook it in 1125 during its [[Jin campaigns against the Song Dynasty|conquest of northern China]].  In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their "Central Capital", called '''Zhongdu'''.<ref name="hist" /> The city was besieged by [[Genghis Khan]]'s invading [[Mongol Empire|Mongolian army]] in 1213 and [[battle of Zhongdu|razed to the ground]] two years later.<ref name="economist">{{cite news |title=Beijing – Historical Background |url=http://www.economist.com/cities/findstory.cfm?city_id=BJS&folder=Facts-History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522144445/http://www.economist.com/cities/findstory.cfm?city_id=BJS&folder=Facts-History |archivedate=22 May 2007 |work=The Economist|year=2007}}</ref> Two generations later, [[Kublai Khan]] ordered the construction of '''[[Khanbaliq|Dadu]]''' (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his [[Yuan dynasty]] to be located adjacent to the Jurchen Jin ruins.

===Ming dynasty===

In 1368, soon after declaring the new [[Hongwu Emperor|Hongwu era]] of the [[Ming dynasty]], the [[Red Turban rebellion|rebel]] leader [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] sent an army to Khanbaliq and conquered it.<ref name="patbu">Ebrey, Patricia Buckley.

The early death of [[Zhu Yuanzhang]]'s heir led to a [[Jingnan Campaign|succession struggle]] on his death, one that ended with the victory of [[Zhu Di]] and the declaration of the new [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle era]]. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital.

The capture of Beijing by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty, but he and his [[Shun dynasty|Shun court]] abandoned the city without a fight when the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] army of Prince [[Dorgon]] arrived 40 days later.

===Republic of China===
[[File:1937 Peking, China VP8.webm|thumb|Beijing filmed in 1937]]
The fomenters of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like [[Sun Yat-sen]] originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general [[Yuan Shikai]] forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=133–134}}</ref> left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies.  Following the success of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]]' [[Northern Expedition (1926–1927)|Northern Expedition]], the capital was formally removed to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as "Peiping").<ref name="columbia encyclopedia" /><ref>{{harvnb|MacKerras|Yorke|1991|p=8}}</ref>

===People's Republic of China===
[[File:PRCFounding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mao Zedong]] proclaiming the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949]]
In the final phases of the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[People's Liberation Army]] seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the [[Pingjin Campaign]]. On 1 October that year, [[Mao Zedong]] announced the creation of the [[People's Republic of China]] from atop [[Tian'anmen]]. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=168}}</ref> a decision that had been reached by the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] just a few days earlier.

In the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in [[Shijingshan District|the west]] and residential neighborhoods in [[Hepingli Subdistrict, Beijing|the north]]. Many areas of the [[Beijing city fortifications|Beijing city wall]] were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the [[Beijing Subway]] and the [[2nd Ring Road]].

[[File:Beijing Olympics 2008.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from the opening ceremonies of the [[2008 Summer Olympic Games]].]]

During the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, the [[Red Guard (China)|Red Guard]] movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges.  By the fall of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.<ref>[http://dangshi.people.com.cn/GB/85039/14329784.html " "毛主席八次接见红卫兵的组织工作" ''中国共产党新闻网''] 7 April 2011 {{zh icon}}</ref>  In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the [[Gang of Four]] and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square [[Tiananmen Incident|was forcefully suppressed]]. In October 1976, the Gang was arrested in [[Zhongnanhai]] and the Cultural Revolution came to an end.  In December 1978, the [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress]] in Beijing under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]] reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the [[Chinese economic reform|"policy of reform and opening up."]]

Since the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd]], [[4th Ring Road|4th]], [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=217}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=255}}</ref> According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=252}}</ref> [[Wangfujing]] and [[Xidan]] have developed into flourishing shopping districts,<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|p=149}}</ref> while [[Zhongguancun]] has become a major center of electronics in China.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=249–250}}</ref> In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as [[Traffic congestion|heavy traffic]], [[Air pollution|poor air quality]], the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed [[rural area]]s of the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Li|Dray-Novey|Kong|2007|pp=255–256}}</ref>  Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]<ref name="BBC News">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4313282.stm Picture Power:Tiananmen Standoff] BBC News.</ref> and the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

==Geography==
{{Main article|Geography of Beijing}}
[[File:Large Beijing Landsat.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Landsat 7]] Satellite image of Beijing Municipality with the surrounding mountains in dark brown]]

Beijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular [[North China Plain]], which opens to the south and east of the city.  Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially [[Yanqing County]] and [[Huairou District]], are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by ''Xishan'' or the [[Western Hills]]. The [[Great Wall of China]] across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with [[Hebei]], is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of {{convert|2303|m}}.
[[File:GreatWall6.jpg|thumb|right|Remnants of the [[Great Wall of China]] in the mountains north of the city.]]

Major rivers flowing through the municipality, including the [[Chaobai River|Chaobai]], [[Yongding River|Yongding]], [[Juma River (China)|Juma]], are all tributaries in the [[Hai River]] system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] to [[Hangzhou]], which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the [[South–North Water Transfer Project]], constructed in the past decade to bring water from the [[Yangtze River]] basin.

The urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of {{convert|40|to(-)|60|m|ft|abbr=off}}, occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric [[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]].  The [[Second Ring Road (Beijing)|Second Ring Road]] traces the [[Beijing city wall|old city walls]] and the [[Sixth Ring Road]] connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. [[Tian'anmen]] and [[Tian'anmen Square]] are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the [[Forbidden City]], the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is [[Zhongnanhai]], the residence of China's current leaders. [[Chang'an Avenue]], which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east-west axis.

===Climate===
Beijing has a monsoon-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dwa''), characterized by higher humidity in the summers due to the East Asian [[monsoon]], and colder, windier, drier winters that reflect the influence of the vast [[Siberian anticyclone]].<ref name="people's daily">{{cite web

Autumn, like spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. The monthly daily average temperature in January is {{convert|−3.7|°C|1}}, while in July it is {{convert|26.2|°C|1}}. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] averages around {{convert|570|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} annually, with close to three-fourths of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,671 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from {{convert|−27.4|°C|1}} on 22 February 1966 to {{convert|41.9|°C|1}} on 24 July 1999 (unofficial record of {{convert|42.6|°C|1}} was set on 15 June 1942).<ref>http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/dataSetLogger.do?changeFlag=dataLogger</ref><ref name = Mherrera />

===Environmental problems===
Beijing has a long history of [[environmental problems]].<ref>[[J. R. McNeill]], ''Something New Under the Sun: An Environmental History of the 20th-Century World''. New York: Norton, 2000, ISBN 978-0-14-029509-2.</ref> Between 2000 and 2009 Beijing's urban extent quadrupled, which not only strongly increased the extent of anthropogenic emissions, but also changed the meteorological situation fundamentally, even if [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] of human society are not included. For example, surface [[albedo]], wind speed and [[humidity]] near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface [[air temperature]]s, vertical air dilution and [[ozone]] levels were increased.<ref>[[Mark Z. Jacobson]], Son V. Nghiem, Alessandro Sorichetta, Natasha Whitney, ''Ring of impact from the mega-urbanization of Beijing between 2000 and 2009''. In: ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]: Atmospheres'' 120, Issue 12, (2015), 5740–5756, {{DOI|10.1002/2014JD023008}}.</ref> Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of [[fossil fuel]], Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to [[health]] issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy [[smog]] struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, in total 600 million people. After this "pollution shock" [[air pollution]] became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.<ref>Peter Sheehan, Enjiang Cheng, Alex English, Fanghong Sun, ''China's response to the air pollution shock''. In: ''[[Nature Climate Change]]'' 4, (2014), 306–309, {{DOI|10.1038/nclimate2197}}.</ref>

====Air quality====
Joint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35–60% of the [[ozone]] can be traced to sources outside the city. [[Shandong]] Province and [[Tianjin]] Municipality have a "significant influence on Beijing's air quality",<ref>David G. Streetsa, Joshua S. Fub, Carey J. Jangc, Jiming Haod, Kebin Hed, Xiaoyan Tange, Yuanhang Zhange, Zifa Wangf, Zuopan Lib, Qiang Zhanga, Litao Wangd, Binyu Wangc, Carolyne Yua, Air quality during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games <[http://www.cee.mtu.edu/~reh/papers/pubs/non_Honrath/streets07.pdf]> accessed 23 April 2012</ref> partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.

Beijing air quality is often poor, especially in winter. In mid-January 2013, Beijing's air quality was measured on top of [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing|the city's American embassy]] at a PM2.5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter, which went off the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index. It was widely reported, originally through a Twitter account, that the category was "crazy bad".

==Politics and government==
{{Main article|Politics of Beijing}}

Municipal government is regulated by the local [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), led by the Beijing [[CPC Secretary]] ({{lang-zh|北京市委书记}}). The local CPC issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.

Government officials include the [[Mayor of Beijing|mayor]] ({{lang-zh|市长}}) and vice-mayor. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions, including the [[National People's Congress]].<ref name="britannica government">{{cite encyclopedia

In 2013, Beijing had a total population of 21.148 million within the municipality, of which 18.251 million resided in urban districts or suburban townships and 2.897 million lived in rural villages.<ref name="2013 Beijing Stats" />  Within China, the city ranked [[List of cities in China by population|second in urban population]] after Shanghai and the [[Direct-controlled municipalities of China|third in municipal population]] after Shanghai and Chongqing.  Beijing also ranks among the most populous cities in the world, [[List of largest cities throughout history|a distinction the city has held for much of the past 800 years]], especially during the 15th to early 19th centuries when it was [[List of largest cities throughout history|the largest city in the world]].

About 13 million of the city's residents in 2013 had local [[Hukou system|''hukou'' permits]], which entitles them to permanent residence in Beijing.<ref name="2013 Beijing Stats" />  The remaining 8 million residents had ''hukou'' permits elsewhere and were not eligible to receive some social benefits provided by the Beijing municipal government.<ref name="2013 Beijing Stats" />

The population increased in 2013 by 455,000 or about 7% from the previous year and continued a decade-long trend of rapid growth.<ref name="2013 Beijing Stats" />  The total population in 2004 was 14.213&nbsp;million.<ref name=2004pop>{{cite web|url=http://www.allcountries.org/china_statistics/4_9_age_composition_and_dependency_ratio.html |title=Age Composition and Dependency Ratio of Population by Region (2004) in China Statistics 2005 |accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref>  The population gains are driven largely by migration.  The population's [[rate of natural increase]] in 2013 was a mere 0.441%, based on a [[birth rate]] of 8.93 and a [[mortality rate]] of 4.52.<ref name="2013 Beijing Stats" />  The [[Human sex ratio|gender balance]] was 51.6% males and 48.4% females.<ref name="2013 Beijing Stats" />

Working age people account for nearly 80% of the population.  Compared to 2004, residents age 0–14 as a proportion of the population dropped from 9.96% to 9.5% in 2013 and residents over the age of 65 declined from 11.12% to 9.2%.<ref name="2013 Beijing Stats" /><ref name=2004pop />

People native to urban Beijing speak the [[Beijing dialect]], which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of [[Chinese spoken language|spoken Chinese]]. This speech is the basis for ''[[putonghua]]'', the standard spoken language used in mainland China and [[Taiwan]], and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have [[Jilu Mandarin|their own dialects]] akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.

Beijing or [[Peking opera]] ({{lang|zh|京剧}}, ''Jīngjù'') is a traditional form of Chinese theatre well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of [[Chinese culture]], Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia

[[Beijing cuisine]] is the local style of cooking. [[Peking Roast Duck]] is perhaps the best known dish. [[Fuling Jiabing]], a traditional Beijing snack food, is a pancake (''bing'') resembling a flat disk with a filling made from ''[[Fu Ling|fu ling]]'', a fungus used in traditional [[Chinese medicine]]. [[Teahouse]]s are common in Beijing.

The [[cloisonné]] (or ''Jingtailan'', literally "Blue of [[Jingtai Emperor|Jingtai]]") metalworking technique and tradition is a Beijing art specialty, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China. Cloisonné making requires elaborate and complicated processes which include base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khulsey.com/travel/china_beijing_crafts_cloisonne.html |title=Beijing – Chinese Cloisonné Enamelware |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080611133538/http://www.khulsey.com:80/travel/china_beijing_crafts_cloisonne.html |archivedate=11 June 2008 }}</ref> Beijing's [[lacquerware]] is also well known for its sophisticated and intrinsic patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer include "carved lacquer" and "engraved gold".

Younger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decades, breaking prior cultural traditions that had practically restricted it to the upper class.<ref>{{cite news

===Architecture===
{{See also|List of tallest buildings in Beijing}}
[[File:View of Beijing.jpg|thumb|City skyline looking east from the Financial Street]]
Three styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive [[Tian'anmen]] (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the [[Forbidden City]], the [[Imperial Ancestral Temple]] and the [[Temple of Heaven]]. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the "Sino-Sov" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book

  |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the [[Beijing CBD]] and [[Beijing Financial Street]].

In the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers. A mixture of both 1950s design and [[neofuturistic]] style of architecture can be seen at the [[798 Art Zone]], which mixes the old with the new.

Beijing is famous for its ''[[siheyuan]]s'', a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the [[Prince Gong Mansion]] and [[Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling (Beijing)|Residence of Soong Ching-ling]]. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called ''[[hutong]]s''. The ''hutongs'' are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good [[Feng Shui]]. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, ''siheyuans'' and ''hutongs'' are rapidly disappearing,<ref>{{cite news

[[File:The Temple of the Town Deity in Beijing1.JPG|thumb|left|One of the temples of the City God of Beijing.]]

====Chinese folk religion and Taoism====
Beijing had many temples dedicated to [[Chinese gods and immortals|folk religious deities]], many of which have been reconstructed or are being reconstructed in the 2000s and 2010s. Yearly sacrifices to the [[Tian|God of Heaven]] (祭天 ''jìtiān'') at the [[Temple of Heaven]] have been resumed by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] groups in the 2010s.

There are temples dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (娘娘 ''Niángniáng'') in the city, one of them near the [[Beijing Olympic Village|Olympic Village]], and they revolve around a major cult centre at [[Mount Miaofeng]]. There are also temples of the [[Dragon King|Dragon God]] (龙神 ''Lóngshén'') and temples of the [[Chenghuangshen|City God]] (城隍神 ''Chénghuángshén''). Many of these temples are governed by the Beijing Taoist Association, such as the [[Huode Zhenjun Temple|Fire God Temple]].

The national [[Chinese Taoist Association]] and Chinese Taoist College have their headquarters at the [[White Cloud Temple]] of [[Quanzhen Taoism]], which was founded in 741 and rebuilt numerous times. The [[Beijing Dongyue Temple]] outside Chaoyangmen is the largest temple of [[Zhengyi Taoism]] in the city. The Beijing Taoist Association has its headquarters at the [[Lüzu Temple]] near Fuxingmen.<ref>(Chinese) [http://www.bjtaoism.net/html/daoxie/node/2345922-1.htm 北京市道教协会协会简介]</ref>

====Buddhism====
[[File:Gfp-china-beijing-worshipping-at-lama-temple.jpg|thumb|[[Yonghe Temple]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] was built in 1694.]]
The [[Buddhist Association of China]], the state's supervisory organ overseeing all [[Buddhist]] institutions in mainland China, is headquartered in the [[Guangji Temple]], a temple founded over 800 years ago during the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] in what is now Fuchengmennei. The Beijing Buddhist Association along with the Buddhist Choir and Orchestra are based in the [[Guanghua Temple (Beijing)|Guanghua Temple]], which dates to the Yuan Dynasty over 700 years ago. The Buddhist Academy of China and its library are housed in the [[Fayuan Temple]] near Caishikou.  The Fayuan Temple, which dates to the Tang Dynasty 1300 years ago, is the oldest temple in urban Beijing. The Tongjiao Temple inside Dongzhimen is the city's only Buddhist nunnery.

The West Yellow Temple originally dates to the Liao Dynasty.  In 1651, the temple was commissioned by the [[Shunzhi Emperor|Qing Emperor Shunzhi]] to host the visit of the [[5th Dalai Lama|Fifth Dalai Lama]] to Beijing. Since then, this temple has hosted the [[13th Dalai Lama]] as well as the [[Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama|Sixth]], [[Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama|Ninth]] and [[Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama|Tenth]] [[Panchen Lama]]s.  The largest Tibetan Buddhist Temple in Beijing is the Yonghe Temple, which was decreed by the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qing Emperor Qianlong]] in 1744 to serve as the residence and research facility for his Buddhist preceptor of [[Changkya Rölpé Dorjé|Rölpé Dorjé]] the third [[Changkya Khutukhtu|Changkya]] (or living Buddha of Inner Mongolia).  The Yonghe Temple is so-named because it was the childhood residence of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and retains the [[Chinese glazed roof tile|glazed tiles]] reserved for imperial palaces.

The Lingguang Temple of Badachu in the Western Hills also dates to the Tang Dynasty.  The temple's Zhaoxian Pagoda was first built in 1071 during the Liao Dynasty to hold a tooth relic of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]].  The pagoda was destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion and the tooth was discovered from its foundation.  A new pagoda was built in 1964. The six aforementioned temples: Guangji, Guanghua, Tongjiao, West Yellow, Yonghe and Lingguang have been designated [[National Key Buddhist Temples in Han Chinese Area]].

In addition, other notable temples in Beijing include the Tanzhe Temple (founded in the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)]] is the oldest in the municipality), [[Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianning Temple]] (oldest pagoda in the city), [[Miaoying Temple]] (famed for Yuan-era white dagoba), the Wanshou Temple (home to the Beijing Art Museum) and [[Big Bell Temple]].

The earliest Protestant churches in Beijing were founded by [[Protestant missions in China 1807–1953|British and American missionaries]] in the second half of the 19th century. Protestant missionaries also opened schools, universities and hospitals which have become important civic institutions.  Most of Beijing's Protestant churches were destroyed during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and rebuilt.  In 1958, the 64 Protestant churches in the city were reorganized into four and overseen by the state through the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]].  In the last 30 years, a number of new Protestant churches have opened in the city, including some by foreign expatriats.

In 1982, the congregation of the Mishi Church joined the Chongwenmen Church.  The London Missionary Society Hospital, built near the Mishi Church, became part of the [[Peking Union Medical College Hospital]].  In 1907, the Church of England founded the [[Holy Saviour's Cathedral (Beijing)|Holy Saviour's Cathedral]], which no longer functions as a church but the architecture remains.  Anglicans also founded Chongde Middle School (now No. 31 Middle School) and Duzhi Middle School (now Luxun Middle School).

Beijing is an important [[transport hub]] in [[North China]] with five [[Ring roads of Beijing|ring roads]], nine expressways, eleven National Highways, nine conventional railways, and two high-speed railways converging on the city.

===Rail and high-speed rail===
Beijing serves as a large rail hub in [[Rail transport in the People's Republic of China|China's railway network]]. Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: [[Beijing-Shanghai Railway|Shanghai (Jinghu Line)]], [[Beijing–Guangzhou Railway|Guangzhou (Jingguang Line)]], [[Beijing–Kowloon Railway|Kowloon (Jingjiu Line)]], [[Beijing-Harbin Railway|Harbin (Jingha Line)]], [[Beijing-Baotou Railway|Baotou (Jingbao Line)]], [[Beijing-Qinhuangdao Railway|Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)]], [[Beijing–Chengde Railway|Chengde (Jingcheng Line)]], [[Beijing–Tongliao Railway|Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line)]], [[Beijing–Yuanping Railway|Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line)]] and [[Fengtai–Shacheng Railway|Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line)]]. In addition, the [[Datong–Qinhuangdao Railway]] passes through the municipality to the north of the city.

Beijing also has three [[high-speed rail]] lines: the [[Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway]], which opened in 2008; the [[Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway]], which opened in 2011; and the [[Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong High-Speed Railway|Beijing–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway]], which opened in 2012.

The city's main railway stations are the [[Beijing Railway Station]], which opened in 1959; the [[Beijing West Railway Station]], which opened in 1996; and the [[Beijing South Railway Station]], which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008. As of 1 July 2010, Beijing Railway Station had 173 trains arriving daily, Beijing West had 232 trains and Beijing South had 163. The [[Beijing North Railway Station]], first built in 1909 and expanded in 2009, had 22 trains.

Smaller stations in the city including [[Beijing East Railway Station]] and [[Qinghuayuan Railway Station]] handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. The Fengtai Railway Station has been closed for renovation. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.<ref>(Chinese) [http://www.oklx.com/cn/train/province/1753ac4e025e.html "北京市火车站大全"] Last Accessed 8 August 2011</ref>

From Beijing, [[Passenger rail transport in China|direct passenger train service]] is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to [[Mongolia]], Russia, [[Vietnam]] and [[North Korea]]. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their [[railroad direction|direction]] in relation to Beijing.

===Roads and expressways===
{{further|Expressways of Beijing|China National Highways of Beijing}}
Beijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Nine [[expressways of China]] serve Beijing, as do eleven [[China National Highway]]s. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the five "[[Ring Roads of Beijing|ring roads]]" that concentrically surround the city, with the [[Forbidden City]] area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official "1st Ring Road". The [[2nd Ring Road]] is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] progressively as they extend outwards, with the [[5th Ring Road|5th]] and [[6th Ring Road]]s being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the [[3rd Ring Road (Beijing)|3rd Ring Road]] outward. A final outer orbital, the [[G95 Capital Regional Greater Ring|Capital Ring Expressway (G95)]], is being built and will extend into neighbouring [[Tianjin]] and [[Hebei]].

Within the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with "inner" and "outer" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.

Beijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.<ref>{{cite news

 |accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref>

Towards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chinaautoweb.com/2010/12/to-tackle-traffic-jam-beijing-sets-new-car-plate-quota-limits-out-of-towners/ |title=To Tackle Traffic Jam, Beijing Sets New Car Plate Quota, Limits Out-of-Towners |publisher=ChinaAutoWeb.com}}</ref> More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.

===Air===
Beijing's primary airport is the [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: PEK) about {{convert|20|km}} northeast of the city center.  The airport is the [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|second busiest airport in the world]] after [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]].<ref name="ACI aero" />  After renovations for the 2008 Olympics, the airport now boasts three terminals, with Terminal 3 being one of the largest in the world. Most domestic and nearly all international flights arrive at and depart from Capital Airport. It is the main hub for [[Air China]] and a hub for [[China Southern]] and [[Hainan Airlines]]. The airport links Beijing with almost every other Chinese city with regular air passenger service.

The [[Airport Expressway (Beijing)|Airport Expressway]] links the airport to central Beijing; it is a roughly 40-minute drive from the city center during good traffic conditions. Prior to the 2008 Olympics, the [[2nd Airport Expressway]] was built to the airport, as well as a [[light rail]] system, which now connects to the [[Beijing Subway]].

Other airports in the city include Liangxiang, [[Beijing Nanyuan Airport|Nanyuan]], Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling. These airports are primarily for military use and are less well known to the public. Nanyuan serves as the hub for only one passenger airline.

On December 28, 2014, the Beijing Subway switched to a distance-based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the [[Airport Express, Beijing Subway|Airport Express]].<ref name="english.cri.cn">{{cite web|title = Beijing to Increase Public Transportation Fare Prices Next Month|url = http://english.cri.cn/12394/2014/11/27/3781s854098.htm|website = english.cri.cn|accessdate = 2015-12-24}}</ref> Under the new system a trip under 6 [[Kilometre|km]] will cost [[Renminbi|¥]]3.00(0.49 USD), an additional [[Renminbi|¥]]1.00 will be added for the next {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=off}} and the next {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=off}} until the distance for the trip reaches {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=off}}.<ref name="english.cri.cn" /> For every {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=off}} after the original {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=off}} an additional [[Renminbi|¥]]1.00 is added.<ref name="english.cri.cn" /> For example, a {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=off}} trip would cost [[Renminbi|¥]] 8.00.

There are nearly 1,000 [[Beijing Bus|public bus]] and [[Beijing Tram and Trolleybus|trolleybus]] lines in the city, including four [[bus rapid transit]] lines. Standard bus fares are as low as ¥1.00 when purchased with the ''[[Yikatong]]'' metrocard.

===Taxi===
Metered [[taxicab|taxi]] in Beijing start at ¥13 for the first {{convert|3|km}}, ¥2.3 [[Renminbi]] per additional {{convert|1|km}} and ¥1 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are ¥2.3 (¥4.6 during rush hours of 7–9 am and 5–7 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than {{convert|12|kph}} . Most taxis are [[Hyundai Elantra]]s, [[Hyundai Sonata]]s, [[Peugeot]]s, [[Citroën]]s and [[Volkswagen Jetta]]s. After {{convert|15|km}}, the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion ''over'' that distance). Different companies have special colors combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11&nbsp;pm and 5&nbsp;am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.

===Bicycles===
Beijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Large numbers of cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated [[bicycle lanes]]. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of [[electric bicycles]] and [[electric scooters]], which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale.<ref>{{cite news

唐朝安史之亂時，曾稱范陽為“燕京”，約在今河北保定與北京一帶（河北省涿州市）。
北京市，简称“京”，是中华人民共和国首都、直辖市和京津冀城市群的中心，中国的政治、文化、交通、科技创新和国际交往中心，中国经济、金融的决策和管理中心[2][3]。北京是世界上最大的城市之一，具有重要的国际影响力，人类发展指数位居中国省级行政区第一位[4]。
北京位於華北平原的西北边缘，背靠燕山，有永定河流经老城西南，毗邻天津市、河北省，是一座有三千余年建城历史、八百六十余年建都史的历史文化名城，历史上有金、元、明、清、中华民国（北洋政府时期）等五个朝代在此定都，以及数个政权建政于此，荟萃了自元明清以来的中华文化，拥有众多历史名胜古迹和人文景观。公元前1046年周武王灭商后，封宗室召公奭于燕国，是为北京建城之始。金中都时期人口超过一百万。金中都为元、明、清三代的北京城的建设奠定了基础。北京与西安、南京、洛阳并称中国“四大古都”，拥有7项世界遗产，是世界上拥有文化遗产项目数最多的城市。
《不列颠百科全书》将北京形容为全球最伟大的城市之一，而且断言“这座城市是中国历史上最重要的组成部分。在中国过去的8个世纪里，几乎北京所有主要建筑都拥有着不可磨灭的民族和历史意义”。北京古迹众多，著名的有故宫、天坛、颐和园、圆明园、北海公园等。[5]
今日的北京，更已发展成为一座现代化的国际大都市：清华大学、北京大学、中国科学院坐落北京市区；金融街是中国的金融管理中心；北京商务中心区是北京经济的象征；798艺术区是世界知名的当代艺术中心；此外，中国国家大剧院、北京首都国际机场3号航站楼、中央电视台总部大楼、“鸟巢”、“水立方”等具有现代风格的建筑成为古老北京新的名片。每年有超过1亿4700万人到北京旅游。[6]

主条目：北京历史
北京作为城市的历史可以追溯到3,000年前。秦汉以来，北京地区一直是華夏民族北方的军事和商业重镇，名称先后称为蓟城、燕都、燕京、幽州、幽燕、南京、圣都、中都、大都、北平、北京、京师、京城、京都、京畿、京兆、顺天府、首都等。
古代[编辑]
早在西周初年，周武王即封召公奭于今日中國北京及附近地区，称燕國[7]，都城在今北京房山区的琉璃河镇，遗址尚存。[8] 又封尧之后人[9]（一说黄帝后人[10]）于蓟，在今北京市西南[11]。后燕国灭蓟国[12]，迁都于蓟，统称为燕都或燕京。
秦代设北京为蓟县，为广阳郡郡治。
汉高祖五年，今中國北京地被划入燕国辖地。元凤元年复为广阳郡蓟县，属幽州。本始元年因有帝亲分封于此，故更为广阳国首府。
东汉光武改制时，置幽州刺史部于蓟县。永元八年复为广阳郡治所。
西晋时，朝廷改广阳郡为燕国，而幽州迁至范阳。十六国后赵时，幽州驻所迁回蓟县，燕国改设为燕郡，历经前燕、前秦、北燕、后燕和北魏的统治而不变。
隋开皇三年废除燕郡。但很快在大业三年，隋朝改幽州为涿郡。
唐武德年间，涿郡复称为幽州。贞观元年，幽州划归河北道监察区。后北京成为范阳节度使的驻地。安史之乱期间，杂胡安禄山在范陽（今日北京、保定附近）称帝，建国号为“大燕”。唐朝平乱后，复置幽州，归卢龙节度使节制[註 1]。
五代初期，军阀刘仁恭割据此地，后其子刘守光称燕王，被后唐消灭。后晋的建立者沙陀人石敬瑭为了打败后唐，投降契丹人，将燕云十六州在后晋天福元年(936年)送给契丹。这16州是：幽（今北京市）、蓟（今天津蓟县）、瀛（今河北河间）、莫（今河北任丘）、涿（今河北涿州）、檀（今北京密云）、顺（今北京顺义）、新（今河北涿鹿）、妫（原属北京怀来，今为官厅水库库区）、儒（今北京延庆）、武（今河北宣化）、蔚（今河北蔚县）、云（今山西大同）、应（今山西应县）、寰（今山西朔县东马邑镇）、朔（今山西朔县），并向契丹称自己為儿皇帝。 石敬瑭割让包括今北京在内的燕云十六州为辽国或金国后来对后汉、后周、宋朝威胁打开了门户。
北宋初年，宋太宗在高梁河（今北京市海淀区）与辽战斗，意图收复被后晋割让的燕云十六州未果；辽于会同元年起在北京地区建立了陪都，号南京幽都府，开泰元年改号析津府。北宋末年联金灭辽，曾短暂收复燕云十六州，并设置了燕山府路和云中府路，北京属于燕山府路。金朝以张觉事件为借口大举攻宋，再次出兵燕山府。
贞元元年三月二十六日（公元1153年4月21日），金朝皇帝完颜亮正式迁都于北京，并动用了120万人建设这座城市。完颜亮改燕京为圣都，不久又称大兴府，这是北京历史上第一次成为古代中国的首都。此后元、明、清均建都于此，至今已有八百余年建都史。 金中都人口最盛时超过一百万，城内居住着汉、女真、渤海、契丹、回鹘、突厥、波斯、大食等众多部族，东西方众多文化在北京得以交流融合、兼容并蓄，北京从此成为国际性都市。
金中都的建成使之成为当时世界上最繁华的商业大都市。当时海陵王完颜亮将皇族贵戚全部迁到中都，为了断绝退路，还将旧都上京会宁府的宫殿豪宅彻底夷毁。大批贵族官僚阶层的进入中都，使得中都商业迅速发展。史籍记载:完颜亮注重减轻赋税，缓和民族矛盾，休养生息，使农业得到发展，商业繁荣，市场兴盛。这段时期史书称之为“小尧舜”。完颜亮在中都之东开通了潞河，潞城因此改名通州，西面则建成卢沟桥(金大定二十九年公元1189年始建石桥，三年后的金章宗明昌三年公元1192年建成，当时称广利桥)，使西南陆路各种货物可以直接进入中都。金代还首创了漕运形式，即从水路运送粮米到京城。
蒙古帝国成吉思汗麾下大将木华黎从1214年农历五月开始到1215年农历五月攻下金中都，对中都整整围困了将近一年之久。城破后展开了为期一个月的大屠杀，超过百万人殒命，又纵火焚城，几乎彻底毁灭了这座城市，史称“中都之屠”[13]。金朝著名大词人元好问的胞兄元好古也在屠城中丧命。元世祖至元元年改稱中都路大兴府。至元九年，中都大兴府正式改名为大都路（突厥语为Khanbalik，意为“汗城”，音译为汗八里、甘巴力克）。据《马可波罗游记》叙述：京師蒙古人笃信藏傳佛教，象为佛教祥兽，当时大都常有大象漫步。
明朝初年，以金陵应天府 (今南京市) 为京师，大都路于洪武元年八月改称为北平府，同年十月应军事需要划归山东行省。洪武二年三月，改为北平承宣布政使司驻地。
燕王朱棣经靖难之变夺得皇位后，于永乐元年升燕京北平为北京，暫稱“行在”（天子行銮驻跸的所在，就称“行在”）且常驻于此，现在的北京也从此得名。朱棣行在北京后，一改元態，北京城秩序井然，繁榮安樂。
永乐十九年正月，明成祖朱棣正式移鼎燕京，以燕京为京师，稱為「北京」。金陵应天府则作为留都，称南京。明仁宗的部分时期，則因皇帝個人的喜好因素，北京之法律地位还曾一度由首都，短暂降為君主暫幸之行在，复稱金陵应天府為南京，明英宗正統時才恢復燕京京师的地位。
清朝順治帝入关后即进驻北京，亦称北京为京师顺天府，属直隶省。清廷在北京实行旗民分居政策，即满汉蒙八旗居住内城，非旗籍汉人和回民居住外城。旗人事务由九門提督管理，而汉族、回族事务则交给顺天府衙门管理。
近现代[编辑]

晚清所建的恭王府

清末，北京一中心街道
晚清时期（1860年－1912年） 清朝咸豐帝1860年北京条约签订以后，外国使节和基督教传教士得到特许允进北京，在城内各处兴建教堂，使馆则集中在东交民巷。
中华民国初年（1912年－1928年）
1911年辛亥革命后，民国元年1月1日，中华民国定都金陵，稱南京。同年3月袁世凱北洋政府迁都北京，升格首都。民国伊始，北京的地方体制仍依清制，称顺天府。直至民国三年，改顺天府为京兆地方，直辖于北洋政府。这一时期，北京新建了有轨电车系统，和一批现代的文化教育机构，如北京大学、燕京大学、清华大学、辅仁大学、协和医学院等。
民国十七年国民革命军北伐，攻北京，张作霖退回關外。后被日本關東軍謀刺於皇姑屯，东北易帜，北洋政府结束运作。
国军北伐至人民解放军进驻北平（1928年-1949年）
1928年北伐战争后，中国的首都迁到金陵，為南京。撤销原京兆地方，北京遂改名为北平特别市。1930年6月，北平降格为河北省省辖市，同年12月复升为院辖市。这一时期，北京尽管不具首都的地位，但在教育方面仍有关键的优势，被国际人士称为“中国的波士顿”。
1937年七·七事变后，北平被日軍占领，将北平改名为北京。1945年日本宣布向同盟国投降，中国抗日战争结束。同年8月21日第十一战区孙连仲部接收北京，并更名北平。
中华人民共和国建立后（1949年─）
1949年1月31日，傅作义与中国共产党达成和平协议，率中华民国国军25万人改投中共，中国人民解放军和平进入北平市，史称“北平和平解放”。同年9月27日中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议通过《关于中华人民共和国国都、纪年、国歌、国旗的决议》，中华人民共和国的国都定于北平，同时北平復名为北京。1949年10月1日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府在北京宣告成立。

環境污染[编辑]
空气质量

北京卫星照片，拍摄于2010年8月。
北京的空气污染一直为人诟病，空气的主要污染源为工业废气及汽车尾气排放。

根据联合国环境规划署统计，中国政府近年来花费超过1700亿美元治理北京的环境污染[21]，同時也實行了一系列提升北京市空氣質量的措施。這些措施包括將首钢总公司分批遷移至河北省，並關閉很多对环境造成高污染的企业[22]；使用天然气、电力等清洁能源的節能環保公交车[23]；对政府和私人汽车采取限制行驶的措施；大幅降低公交车、地铁票价以鼓励北京市民尽可能利用公共交通工具出行；在北京奥运期间，利用可再生能源来对约20%的奥运场地进行电力供应；禁止尾气排放污染量大的的“黄标车”进入市区；[24] 在北京周边的内蒙古、山西等地大力植树以提高绿化率等。
奥运会之后，北京的空气质量并未因此而好转，2011年2月21日，美国驻华大使馆录得的北京空气污染指数已超过了正常的可测量范围，[25] 北京市气象部门亦在2月24日通报称，截止当日北京空气质量已连续三天达到重度污染。[26]亚洲开发银行和清华大学发布《中华人民共和国国家环境分析》报告成北京市为世界十大空气污染城市之一。[27]
飞絮则是北京每年4、5月間另一特有现象，其来源以杨絮為主，也有柳絮。由於北京城市道路绿化曾以毛白楊作為主要树种，而其白絮极易随风飘扬，因此形成了北京春天漫天飞杨絮的景观，也造成了一定程度的环境污染。随着近年来北京市通過樹幹注射抑止劑、嫁接以及用其他樹種逐漸取代毛白楊等方法治理楊柳飛絮，飞絮现象已逐漸得到控制[28]。

雾霾笼罩下的北京CBD
2011年11月-12月，北京市遭遇了持续近一个月的烟霾天气，美国驻华大使馆测量的空气污染指数连续“爆表”，[29] 然而北京市环保局发布的空气污染级别却为“轻度污染”，[30] 引发公众疑虑。后有媒体爆料，当今世界上发达国家普遍开始采用的空气污染测量标准为PM2.5（直径2.5微米的空气颗粒，乃影响大气透明度的首要污染物，同时由于其粒径较小容易进入人体）。但由于中国当时采用的国家标准为PM10，因此无法做到全面防范和测量空气污染。[31][32] 北京市环保局表示拒绝采纳和公布PM2.5的数值。[29]
然而北京市环保局在2011年12月初声称北京当年空气质量乃史上最佳，引发轩然大波。有媒体将此新闻与北京空气污染的照片相对比以示嘲讽。[33]
随着北京市空气质量的急剧恶化，舆论呼吁官方尽快将PM2.5作为国内测量标准[29]，迫于舆论的压力，中国环保部宣布将在2012年在京津地区开始试点PM2.5监测，并于2016年开始全国范围的推广。[34] 2012年2月2日，北京市首次公布PM2.5日均浓度。[35]
2013年1月13日，北京空氣污染程度創歷史紀錄。北京的空氣質量繼續惡化。官方機構建議兩千萬北京市民盡量不要出行。尤其是兒童及病患者則更應該盡量縮短外出時間。三天來，北京以及中國其他各大北部城市持續受霧霾天氣影響，已經嚴重超過平時的空氣污染級別。新華社於當天發布信息稱，北京1月12日的PM2.5指數瀕臨“爆表”，空氣質量持續六級嚴重污染。同時，美國駐華大使館在其使館內測量的空氣污染指數也於當天呈現出創紀錄的600點，甚至於當地時間下午一度達到699點。在此之前，美國駐華大使館測量北京空氣污染指數的最高值一直停留在500點左右，該指數為50點時代表空氣質量良好，超過300點就已經進入警戒級別。[36]
2013年，北京的PM2.5年均浓度约为90微克，其中PM2.5浓度每立方米≤12微克（即美国1级标准）的时次占比约为10%，≤35微克（美国2级标准）约占30%，≤55微克（美国3级标准）约占45%，＞150微克（重度污染）约占20%，＞250微克(严重污染）约占5%，而>500微克（即爆表）约占0.5%，相较其他中国东部城市，北京的空气质量明显呈现多变和两极化的特点，对风向十分敏感。[37]
沙尘暴
从中国北部和西北部沙漠侵蚀而来的沙尘让北京的天空常有烟霭及浮尘，每年春季初期甚至会有“沙尘暴”现象，不过实际上一般达不到气象上沙尘暴的标准（即能见度不足1公里）。

明清時設置順天府管轄首都地區，地位與今日的北京市類似，但管轄面積不同。
民國初年北洋政府仍定都北京，1913年改順天府為京兆地方，範圍規格與順天府大致相同，直隸於中央。
1928年6月，北伐軍攻入北京，乃廢除京兆地方建制，改北京為北平，初設北平特別市，直隸南京國民政府，後改稱北平市，隸屬於行政院。日據時期成立北京市政府，日本戰敗投降後恢復原北平市建制。北平市所轄範圍較之前順天府、京兆地方及今日北京市為小，大致包括今西城区、东城区全境，朝阳区大部、海淀区南半部、石景山区北部和丰台区南半部[38]。
1949年中華人民共和國成立並定都北京後，北京市辖范围几经扩大。1952年，河北省宛平县划归北京市。1956年，昌平县划归北京市。1958年3月7日，将通县、顺义、大兴、良乡、房山五个县区划归北京市。同年10月20日，怀柔、密云、平谷、延庆四个县又被划归北京市。至此形成了今日北京市的轄界。
在現今北京市市轄區中，东城、西城兩區位於城市的中心區域，管轄範圍也以今二環路以内、清代舊城範圍為主，是传统意义上的市区。而随着北京城市化进程的加快，人口的增多和城市范围的扩张，朝阳区、海淀区、丰台區和石景山区四個近郊區的大部分地區也逐步被認同為市區，於是和原先的兩個城區一起，形成了城六區的概念。並且多数郊县也已先後改为市轄區[39]。规划中北京市城区范围是五环以内，面积约为667平方公里。
截至2009年，北京辖16区、2县，乡级行政区划包括135街道、142建制镇和40建制乡（其中包括5个民族乡）[40]。
2010年7月1日中国国务院批准撤销原东城区、西城区、崇文区、宣武区四个区，由原东城区和崇文区合并成立新的东城区，西城区和宣武区合并成立新的西城区。[41] 这样北京市的中心城区合并为两个，城近郊结构就也由以前的“城八区”变为“城六区”。2015年11月，中华人民共和国国务院已经批准北京市调整行政区划，密云、延庆两县将撤县设区，至此北京将不再设有以“县”为名称的县级行政单位[42]。
北京市的 市辖区，按照功能划分成四层：
首都功能核心区：东城区、西城区
城市功能拓展区：朝阳区、丰台区、石景山区、海淀区
城市功能新区：房山区、通州区、顺义区、昌平区、大兴区
生态涵养区：门头沟区、怀柔区、平谷区、密云区、延庆区
現今狭义的北京可僅指北京市区，大约就是城六区的範圍，而广义的北京则代指包括郊区县在内隶属北京市政府管辖北京直辖市。

交通[编辑]
主条目：北京交通
北京交通发达，是中国最大的铁路、公路及航空交通中心，也是乃至整個東亞地區的重要交通樞紐，擁有完善的城市交通网。北京市現有1條大外環（總長度超過900公里，2011年初已建成和在建386公里；未建里程约510公里，其中密云至廊坊140公里(包括北京段87公里)、承德至张家口370多公里[43]）、7條主城區環路（其中新七環修完一半，工程擱置）、16條高速公路和城市快速路、11條中國國道[註 2]、數條鐵路和1個國際機場（北京首都第二机场在建）。2012年，北京市汽車擁有量達到520萬[44]。
放射型城市的单极交通體系發展較城市發展相對滯後等多方面原因也使交通擁堵成為了北京長期面對的問題[45][46]。甚至有北京当地媒体预言，北京将在2015年变成
